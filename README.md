# TongEngine  
#### Introduction  
The original intention of TONGEngine design is only to make it easier for developers to develop WebGL 3D and even improve 2D in the future. It is our ultimate goal to solve the actual problem. It is free of download and installation. The engine was released in version 1.0 in July 2017. After the release, it found that it could not solve most of the actual development problems! For us, it is very important for users to be able to participate in the development of the engine and to meet the development of their own project functions. After that, we deepened and refactored the core architecture of the engine, and released the 2.0 version with component development ideas. Now users can enter the development environment through http://tong3d.com! The engine supports physical system, scripting, animation editing system, sky box, video texture, audio playback, shader writing, hinge, Flare, 3D text, OnGUI drawing, multi-scenes management and other functions. It must have deficiencies, but we are working hard to do every function, I hope it can help you.   
The rendering system is based on three.js and the physical system is based on cannon.js.
